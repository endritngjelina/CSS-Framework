# CSS Framework – Custom UI Practice

This project is my personal attempt to build a **lightweight CSS framework** from scratch.  
Each version explores different styling ideas, layout systems, and reusable UI elements using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

The goal is to create my own front-end building blocks without relying on existing frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind.

### 📁 Versions

- `CSS framework 0.html` – Initial structure and basic resets  
- `CSS framework 1.html` – Added basic grid and spacing  
- `CSS framework 2.html` – Introduced buttons, cards, and colors  
- `CSS framework 3.html` – Improved responsiveness  
- `CSS framework 4.html` – Refined components and added interactivity

### 💡 Goals

- Build a flexible, reusable component library  
- Understand how front-end frameworks work under the hood  
- Strengthen my layout, spacing, and design systems  
- Learn to structure scalable front-end code

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for structure  
- **CSS** – for framework styling and utilities  
- **JavaScript** – for basic interactive elements

This is still in progress and will be updated as I experiment further.
